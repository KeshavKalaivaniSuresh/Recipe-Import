    prompt = f"""Extract this recipe into JSON with these exact keys:
name, servings, prep_time_minutes, cook_time_minutes,
ingredients (list of objects with quantity, unit, name, note),
steps (list of strings).

IMPORTANT: If the source text is written in a language other than English, you MUST translate
the recipe name, ingredient names, notes, and steps into English in your JSON output.
Do not leave any field in the original non-English script. However, keep well-known
regional ingredient or dish names in their commonly used English form (e.g. "jeera",
"paneer", "dal") rather than a literal translation, if that is how they are normally
referred to in English.

If a quantity contains clearly garbled, nonsensical, or mixed-up characters (such as random
letters mixed with numbers or symbols, which can happen when text was poorly read from a
scanned image), do NOT guess a plausible-looking number — instead, set quantity to null and
add a short note like "quantity unclear in source". However, standard fraction symbols (½, ⅓,
¼, ⅔, ¾, etc.) are always valid and should be confidently converted to their decimal or
fractional value — do not treat these as unclear.

If there are no method/steps in the source at all, return an empty list for steps.
Do NOT invent a placeholder sentence such as "no steps provided" — an empty list is correct
and expected in this situation.

Include every instruction from the source as a separate step, in the same order,
even short ones like "done" or "serve". Do not skip, merge, or summarize steps.
Exclude any conversational filler, small talk, greetings, comments to viewers,
or asides unrelated to actually preparing the dish (e.g. "let me know in the comments",
talking to people in the room, thanking viewers). Only include genuine cooking instructions.
Cross-check the ingredients list against the steps: if a step mentions using something
(e.g. an ingredient, sauce, or seasoning) that isn't already in the ingredients list, add it
to the ingredients list too, using null for quantity/unit if not stated.
If the same ingredient is mentioned more than once, merge it into a single entry instead of
listing it twice, combining quantities if possible.
If a time is only vaguely implied (not stated as a number), use null rather than guessing.
If something is not mentioned, use null. Do not invent anything.
If the text is not a recipe at all (no ingredients or cooking instructions),
return every field as null or an empty list — do not treat unrelated sentences as steps.
Reply with ONLY the JSON, nothing else, no markdown formatting.
